# How to run this sample app "Shopping List"

### `yarn start`

This bad boy will install all of the npm packages for both the challenge-ui app and the challenge-api app and also this outer project as well.

It will also run the setup for Prisma (ORM for NodeJs) which will generate a Sqlite db and run some migrations.

Finally it will start both the Api server and the Client UI for you.

## Please Note

I wanted to include more in the sample project but unfortunately time was limited. A couple of the things that I didn't get to were: "Form validation" and "refactoring the Graphql TypeDefs and Resolvers into their own respective files for maintainabilty". Maybe later...
